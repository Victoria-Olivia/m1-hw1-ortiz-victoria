## About Me
Hello, my name is Victoria. I believe the secret to life is to love all, trust a few, and do wrong to none. My degree background in creative writing and film cinema studies allows me to explore my passion for publishing, storytelling, screenwriting, experimental art, film, and digital photography. This journey has knocked me into a web and graphic design path, which has helped me create marketing, brand logos, and book covers for creative projects. Go Gators!üêä
## Past Coding Experience

2. Publish Written Works.
3. Sell A Script. 
4. Produce Indie Films.
5. Own A Small Studio.
